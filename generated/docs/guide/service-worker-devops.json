It explains how the Angular service worker fits into the larger production environment, the service worker's behavior under various conditions, and available recourses and fail-safes.</p>\n<h4 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"prerequisites\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#prerequisites\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Prerequisites</h4>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">A basic understanding of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"guide/service-worker-communications\">Service Worker Communication</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"service-worker-and-caching-of-app-resources\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#service-worker-and-caching-of-app-resources\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Service worker and caching of app resources</h2>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">Conceptually, you can imagine the Angular service worker as a forward cache or a CDN edge that is installed in the end user's web browser. The service worker's job is to satisfy requests made by the Angular app for resources or data from a local cache, without needing to wait for the network. Like any cache, it has rules for how content is expired and updated.</p>\n<a id=\"versions\"></a>\n<h3 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"app-versions\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#app-versions\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>App versions</h3>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">In the context of an Angular service worker, a \"version\" is a collection of resources that represent a specific build of the Angular app. Whenever a new build of the app is deployed, the service worker treats that build as a new version of the app. This is true even if only a single file is updated. At any given time, the service worker may have multiple versions of the app in its cache and it may be serving them simultaneously. For more information, see the <a href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#tabs\">App tabs</a> section below.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">To preserve app integrity, the Angular service worker groups all files into a version together. The files grouped into a version usually include HTML, JS, and CSS files. Grouping of these files is essential for integrity because HTML, JS, and CSS files frequently refer to each other and depend on specific content. For example, an <code>index.html</code> file might have a <code>&#x3C;script></code> tag that references <code>bundle.js</code> and it might attempt to call a function <code>startApp()</code> from within that script. Any time this version of <code>index.html</code> is served, the corresponding <code>bundle.js</code> must be served with it. For example, assume that the <code>startApp()</code> function is renamed to <code>runApp()</code> in both files. In this scenario, it is not valid to serve the old <code>index.html</code>, which calls <code>startApp()</code>, along with the new bundle, which defines <code>runApp()</code>.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">This file integrity is especially important when lazy loading modules.\nA JS bundle may reference many lazy chunks, and the filenames of the\nlazy chunks are unique to the particular build of the app. If a running\napp at version <code>X</code> attempts to load a lazy chunk, but the server has\nupdated to version <code>X + 1</code> already, the lazy loading operation will fail.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">The version identifier of the app is determined by the contents of all\nresources, and it changes if any of them change. In practice, the version\nis determined by the contents of the <code>ngsw.json</code> file, which includes\nhashes for all known content. If any of the cached files change, the file's\nhash will change in <code>ngsw.json</code>, causing the Angular service worker to\ntreat the active set of files as a new version. </p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">With the versioning behavior of the Angular service worker, an application\nserver can ensure that the Angular app always has a consistent set of files.</p>\n<h4 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"update-checks\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#update-checks\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Update checks</h4>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">Every time the user opens or refreshes the application, the Angular service worker\nchecks for updates to the app by looking for updates to the <code>ngsw.json</code> manifest. If\nan update is found, it is downloaded and cached automatically, and will be served\nthe next time the application is loaded.</p>\n<h3 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"resource-integrity\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#resource-integrity\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Resource integrity</h3>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">One of the potential side effects of long caching is inadvertently\ncaching an invalid resource. In a normal HTTP cache, a hard refresh\nor cache expiration limits the negative effects of caching an invalid\nfile. A service worker ignores such constraints and effectively long\ncaches the entire app. Consequently, it is essential that the service worker\nget the correct content.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">To ensure resource integrity, the Angular service worker validates\nthe hashes of all resources for which it has a hash. Typically for\na CLI app, this is everything in the <code>dist</code> directory covered by\nthe user's <code>src/ngsw-config.json</code> configuration.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">If a particular file fails validation, the Angular service worker\nattempts to re-fetch the content using a \"cache-busting\" URL\nparameter to eliminate the effects of browser or intermediate\ncaching. If that content also fails validation, the service worker\nconsiders the entire version of the app to be invalid and it stops\nserving the app. If necessary, the service worker enters a safe mode\nwhere requests fall back on the network, opting not to use its cache\nif the risk of serving invalid, broken, or outdated content is high.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">Hash mismatches can occur for a variety of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">Caching layers in between the origin server and the end user could serve stale content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">A non-atomic deployment could result in the Angular service worker having visibility of partially updated content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">Errors during the build process could result in updated resources without <code>ngsw.json</code> being updated. The reverse could also happen resulting in an updated <code>ngsw.json</code> without updated resources.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"unhashed-content\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#unhashed-content\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Unhashed content</h4>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">The only resources that have hashes in the <code>ngsw.json</code>\nmanifest are resources that were present in the <code>dist</code>\ndirectory at the time the manifest was built. Other\nresources, especially those loaded from CDNs, have\ncontent that is unknown at build time or are updated\nmore frequently than the app is deployed.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">If the Angular service worker does not have a hash to validate\na given resource, it still caches its contents but it honors\nthe HTTP caching headers by using a policy of \"stale while\nrevalidate.\" That is, when HTTP caching headers for a cached\nresource indicate that the resource has expired, the Angular\nservice worker continues to serve the content and it attempts\nto refresh the resource in the background. This way, broken\nunhashed resources do not remain in the cache beyond their\nconfigured lifetimes.</p>\n<a id=\"tabs\"></a>\n<h3 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"app-tabs\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#app-tabs\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>App tabs</h3>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">It can be problematic for an app if the version of resources\nit's receiving changes suddenly or without warning. See the\n<a href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#versions\">Versions</a> section above\nfor a description of such issues.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">The Angular service worker provides a guarantee: a running app\nwill continue to run the same version of the app. If another\ninstance of the app is opened in a new web browser tab, then\nthe most current version of the app is served. As a result,\nthat new tab can be running a different version of the app\nthan the original tab.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">It's important to note that this guarantee is <strong>stronger</strong>\nthan that provided by the normal web deployment model. Without\na service worker, there is no guarantee that code lazily loaded\nlater in a running app is from the same version as the initial\ncode for the app.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">There are a few limited reasons why the Angular service worker\nmight change the version of a running app. Some of them are\nerror conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">The current version becomes invalid due to a failed hash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">An unrelated error causes the service worker to enter safe mode; that is, temporary deactivation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">The Angular service worker is aware of which versions are in\nuse at any given moment and it cleans up versions when\nno tab is using them.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">Other reasons the Angular service worker might change the version\nof a running app are normal events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">The page is reloaded/refreshed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">The page requests an update be immediately activated via the <code><a href=\"api/service-worker/SwUpdate\" class=\"code-anchor\">SwUpdate</a></code> service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"service-worker-updates\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#service-worker-updates\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Service worker updates</h3>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">The Angular service worker is a small script that runs in web browsers.\nFrom time to time, the service worker will be updated with bug\nfixes and feature improvements. </p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">The Angular service worker is downloaded when the app is first opened\nand when the app is accessed after a period of inactivity. If the\nservice worker has changed, the service worker will be updated in the background.  </p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">Most updates to the Angular service worker are transparent to the\napp—the old caches are still valid and content is still served\nnormally. However, occasionally a bugfix or feature in the Angular\nservice worker requires the invalidation of old caches. In this case,\nthe app will be refreshed transparently from the network.</p>\n<h2 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"debugging-the-angular-service-worker\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#debugging-the-angular-service-worker\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Debugging the Angular service worker</h2>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">Occasionally, it may be necessary to examine the Angular service\nworker in a running state to investigate issues or to ensure that\nit is operating as designed. Browsers provide built-in tools for\ndebugging service workers and the Angular service worker itself\nincludes useful debugging features.</p>\n<h3 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"locating-and-analyzing-debugging-information\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#locating-and-analyzing-debugging-information\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Locating and analyzing debugging information</h3>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">The Angular service worker exposes debugging information under\nthe <code>ngsw/</code> virtual directory. Currently, the single exposed URL\nis <code>ngsw/state</code>. Here is an example of this debug page's contents:</p>\n<code-example>\nNGSW Debug Info:\n\nDriver state: NORMAL ((nominal))\nLatest manifest hash: eea7f5f464f90789b621170af5a569d6be077e5c\nLast update check: never\n\n=== <a href=\"api/core/Version\" class=\"code-anchor\">Version</a> eea7f5f464f90789b621170af5a569d6be077e5c ===\n\nClients: 7b79a015-69af-4d3d-9ae6-95ba90c79486, 5bc08295-aaf2-42f3-a4cc-9e4ef9100f65\n\n=== Idle Task Queue ===\nLast update <a href=\"api/core/testing/tick\" class=\"code-anchor\">tick</a>: 1s496u\nLast update run: never\nTask queue:\n\n * init post-load (update, cleanup)\n\nDebug log:\n</code-example>\n<h4 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"driver-state\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#driver-state\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Driver state</h4>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">The first line indicates the driver state: </p>\n<code-example>\nDriver state: NORMAL ((nominal))\n</code-example>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\"><code>NORMAL</code> indicates that the service worker is operating normally and is not in a degraded state. </p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">There are two possible degraded states:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\"><code>EXISTING_CLIENTS_ONLY</code>: the service worker does not have a\nclean copy of the latest known version of the app. Older cached\nversions are safe to use, so existing tabs continue to run from\ncache, but new loads of the app will be served from the network.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\"><code>SAFE_MODE</code>: the service worker cannot guarantee the safety of\nusing cached data.

While its\ndesign attempts to minimize the impact of such problems, the\nAngular service worker contains several failsafe mechanisms in case\nan administrator ever needs to deactivate the service worker quickly.</p>\n<h2 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"fail-safe\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#fail-safe\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Fail-safe</h2>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">To deactivate the service worker, remove or rename the\n<code>ngsw-config.json</code> file. When the service worker's request\nfor <code>ngsw.json</code> returns a <code>404</code>, then the service worker\nremoves all of its caches and de-registers itself,\nessentially self-destructing.</p>\n<h3 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"safety-worker\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#safety-worker\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Safety Worker</h3>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">Also included in the <code>@angular/service-worker</code> NPM package is a small\nscript <code>safety-worker.js</code>, which when loaded will unregister itself\nfrom the browser. This script can be used as a last resort to get rid\nof unwanted service workers already installed on client pages.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">It's important to note that you cannot register this worker directly,\nas old clients with cached state may not see a new <code>index.html</code> which\ninstalls the different worker script. Instead, you must serve the\ncontents of <code>safety-worker.js</code> at the URL of the Service Worker script\nyou are trying to unregister, and must continue to do so until you are\ncertain all users have successfully unregistered the old worker. For\nmost sites, this means that you should serve the safety worker at the\nold Service Worker URL forever.</p>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">This script can be used both to deactivate <code>@angular/service-worker</code>\nas well as any other Service Workers which might have been served in\nthe past on your site.</p>\n<h2 translation-origin=\"off\" id=\"more-on-angular-service-workers\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#more-on-angular-service-workers\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>More on Angular service workers</h2>\n<p translation-origin=\"off\">You may also be interested in the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"guide/service-worker-config\">Service Worker Configuration</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n<!-- links to this doc:\n - guide/service-worker-communications\n - guide/service-worker-config\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - api/core/Version\n - api/core/testing/tick\n - api/service-worker/SwUpdate\n - guide/service-worker-communications\n - guide/service-worker-config\n - guide/service-worker-devops#app-tabs\n - guide/service-worker-devops#app-versions\n - guide/service-worker-devops#debug-log\n - guide/service-worker-devops#debugging-the-angular-service-worker\n - guide/service-worker-devops#developer-tools\n - guide/service-worker-devops#driver-state\n - guide/service-worker-devops#fail-safe\n - guide/service-worker-devops#idle-task-queue\n - guide/service-worker-devops#last-update-check\n - guide/service-worker-devops#latest-manifest-hash\n - guide/service-worker-devops#locating-and-analyzing-debugging-information\n - guide/service-worker-devops#more-on-angular-service-workers\n - guide/service-worker-devops#prerequisites\n - guide/service-worker-devops#resource-integrity\n - guide/service-worker-devops#safety-worker\n - guide/service-worker-devops#service-worker-and-caching-of-app-resources\n - guide/service-worker-devops#service-worker-in-production\n - guide/service-worker-devops#service-worker-safety\n - guide/service-worker-devops#service-worker-updates\n - guide/service-worker-devops#tabs\n - guide/service-worker-devops#unhashed-content\n - guide/service-worker-devops#update-checks\n - guide/service-worker-devops#version\n - guide/service-worker-devops#versions\n-->"
